Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
 
The class contains:

■ Two double instance variables named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle. 
  
■ A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle. -> width*height
■ A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter. -> 2 * (height + width)

Test your class in the main method by creating two Rectangle objects -> one with width 4 and height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. 
Print out the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle.
